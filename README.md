ESP-IDF template app
====================

This program consists of two esp idf projects, a broadcaster, and a listener. The goal is to measure an approximate time between the time an esp now packet is broadcast, and the time elapsed until the listener receives and processes the broadcasted packet.

## TODO

- Measure the response time of packets of various size
- Measure the response time of packets over various distances
